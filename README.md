# AutoInput
My very simple alternative to AutoHotKey for automating keyboard/mouse input

This program lets you easily get the x,y coordinates for the mouse's current position. It also lets you program 2 macros that you can click buttons to run, and you can repeat them a certain number of times too, so a single mouse click can run the macro 5 times in a row, for example. 

In order to change the macro functionality, you need to change the source code in the Main class. 

This project is intended to be run from IntelliJ, because the macros can only be changed in source code. I could've made it so that it would be a config file rather than hard-coded, but whatever.
